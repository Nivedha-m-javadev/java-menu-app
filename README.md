# Java Menu-Driven Console Application

This project is a modular Java console application developed to practice and demonstrate fundamental Java programming concepts such as:

- Loops and conditionals
- Method creation and reuse
- String manipulation
- Class separation and object-oriented structure
- User input handling using `Scanner`
- Switch-case driven logic flow

The application presents users with a simple menu to perform multiple small tasks interactively.
